# Solution for back-end PHP coding challenge

I have used PHP7 to solve the assignment, as my previous experience is in PHP 5 and 7. The code quality can be further improved using PHP8 e.g. using native enums instead of using abstract classes to get enum-like functionality.
I would also use PHPUnit in real-life scenarios, but due to shortage of time no tests are written.
